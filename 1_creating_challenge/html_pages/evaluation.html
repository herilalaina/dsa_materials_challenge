<h1>Evaluation</h1>

You need to implement a machine learning model in order to classify (Binary classification problem) whether a patch is postive or negative.


<br>
There are 2 phases:
<ul>
<li> <b>Phase 1: development phase. </b> We provide you with labeled training data and unlabeled validation and test data.
Make predictions for both datasets. However, you will receive feed-back on your performance on the validation set only.
The performance of your LAST submission will be displayed on the leaderboard.
<li> <b>Phase 2: final phase.</b> You do not need to do anything. Your last submission of phase 1 will be automatically forwarded.
Your performance on the test set will appear on the leaderboard when the organizers finish checking the submissions.
</ul>

This sample competition allows you to submit either:
<ul>
<li> Only prediction results (no code).
<li> A prediction model that must be trained and tested.
</ul>

The submissions are evaluated using the <b>AUC ROC</b> metric.
